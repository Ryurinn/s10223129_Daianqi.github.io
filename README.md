# My-project-id
This portfolio is created in order to show my personal Portfoilo. This is can shown to potential university /internship in the future so that they can get to know more about me.

The design rationale goes closer to being clean and aesthetic to create a better impression and to read further. The navigation bar allows the people to navigate quickly around my website.

The navigation will be leaded to the following pages, Home-About-Work-Contact.

The home can gives a good impression while the about page gives a brief introduction of myself.

The work page then showcase some of my school works as well as personal work. The page then end off with a contact page with my personal email, contact as well as Country where I am at.

The bottom then shows some of my own social media which can be accessed when pressed.
